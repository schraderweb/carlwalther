                                    </span>So there I was, driving through my native southwest Virginia, enjoying the
                                    mountainous scenery after spending a decade on the wide-open Texas plains. I’d been
                                    that way countless times over the last fifty-odd years, so everything was familiar,
                                    from the banks of Big Walker Creek to the heights of Cloyd’s Mountain and Angel’s
                                    Rest.</p>
                                <p>Shortly after crossing the creek for the second time, however, I realized something
                                    wasn’t right.</p>

                                <p>Off to the left, where there used to be nothing but forest, was a group of buildings.
                                    It looked like a compound, with high chain link fences and stark block structures.
                                    On top of one of these structures was an armored car painted with the black cross of
                                    the German Wehrmacht.</p>
                                <p>That’s not your normal roadside view in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
                                <p>Above the armored car flew a banner bearing the German logo of the Walther Company.
                                    The Walther logo adorned the front of the buildings as well.</p>

                                <p>Well, that was it. Not only am I a World War II scholar with a Wehrmacht
                                    preoccupation, I’m quite possibly the biggest Walther fanboy in this part of the
                                    country. So, just like Burt Reynolds being pursued by Jackie Gleason (well, maybe
                                    not <em>just&nbsp;</em>like that), I spun the car around and gunned it back down the
                                    road toward the pen gate. Could be I just turned around, but I was sure thinking
                                    like Burt Reynolds.</p>

                                <p>What I found was a wonderland of German Walther firearms, including many collectible
                                    and one-of-a-kind examples. Walther and World War II memorabilia litter the place.
                                </p>
                                <p>I was greeted by the owner and proprietor, Earl Sheehan, who invited me to have a
                                    look around. My attention was immediately grabbed by the Wehrmacht
                                    <em>Kubelwagen</em> in the far corner. Roughly equivalent to the American Jeep, the
                                    Kubelwagen served on every front where the Germans fought. This one was decked out
                                    with authentic period gear, including communications equipment, ammo cans, jerry
                                    cans, and helmets. It has valid Virginia plates, and Earl has occasionally driven it
                                    out and about.</p>
                                <p>The other thing that stood out from my first visit was the MG 34 machine gun, a
                                    mainstay of the German forces in WWII.</p>
                                <p>I began to look for more reasons to drive the thirty minutes from my house just so I
                                    could return and look at all the stuff some more. One of those occasions occurred
                                    just a few weeks ago, when I was researching my recent article on the Walther P38/P1
                                    service pistol. As I was speaking with Earl, who has proven very willing to talk to
                                    me each time, it occurred to me that his business was just the sort of establishment
                                    that needed a write-up on B-B-C. He was amenable, so we set it up. Over the course
                                    of two three-hour sessions, I learned quite a bit about this fascinating but
                                    unpretentious gentleman and how he came to accumulate all this cool stuff.</p>
                                <p>Earl grew up on a farm not far from Boston, Massachusetts. This was when the area
                                    still embodied the stubborn, independent attitudes that shaped it as the epicenter
                                    of the American Revolution. He learned to shoot at age five on a .22 caliber
                                    Springfield rifle that belonged to his grandfather. His grandfather gave him the
                                    rifle when he turned six, with the admonition that it would be taken back unless it
                                    was treated and handled with respect. Earl’s grandfather gave him a single round per
                                    day to use however he liked. Under this one-round policy, young Earl quickly learned
                                    not to waste his shots and to hit whatever he was aiming at, because there wouldn’t
                                    be a second chance.</p>

                                <p>It doesn’t take too long for Earl’s blunt libertarian streak to become apparent. It’s
                                    also clear that his bluntness comes honestly. Earl grew up in a time when the local
                                    general store carried dynamite, guns, and ammo by the bushel basket. He speaks of
                                    buying .22 rounds by the pound as a young man in the 1950s. To hear him tell it, it
                                    was the most natural thing in the world. He contrasts that image with the situation
                                    today and discusses how we got to where we are. Freedom, he says, doesn’t just go
                                    away one day. It’s worn down over time, like tapping at a surface with a ball-peen
                                    hammer. But you wake up one day and say, “What the hell happened?”</p>

                                <p>Earl regaled me with lots of stories of his grandfather, father, and himself pushing
                                    back against the ball-peen hammer, but three stand out. Once, when Earl was fifteen,
                                    the local police chief drove up to the farm to inform his grandfather that the State
                                    of Massachusetts now required a firearm ID card for all gun owners. His grandfather
                                    couldn’t understand why and told the chief he would abide by no such law. When the
                                    chief insisted, Grandpa went in the house, got a .22 rifle, and promptly shot the
                                    chief’s hat off his head.</p>
                                <p>The lawman left, and there was no more talk of an ID card for his grandfather.</p>

                                <p>Another time, Earl’s grandfather was driving a tractor on the county road between two
                                    fields. A rookie deputy pulled up behind him and tried to ticket him for driving an
                                    unlicensed vehicle on the road. The response from Earl’s granddad was to back up the
                                    tractor right onto the hood of the police car, caving it in, before resuming his
                                    trip to the next field. I never heard whether there were any consequences for the
                                    action, but Earl maintains that his grandfather never registered the tractor, or any
                                    of his other vehicles, including cars, with the state. He didn’t believe the state
                                    had the right to regulate his property in such a way.</p>
                                <p>Finally, as an adult, Earl had an early 1960s vintage car. One day he was pulled over
                                    and issued a citation for not wearing a seat belt. The only problem was that, in the
                                    early 60s, seat belts were an option on many cars, including that one in which none
                                    were installed. He showed the policeman his owner’s manual, which said as much, but
                                    he got the ticket anyway. He was told that the law said he had to wear a seat belt.
                                </p>
                                <p>So in the spirit of his forebears, Earl went to a junkyard, cut himself a length of
                                    the seatbelt, and sewed it onto the front of a shirt. He wore the shirt to his court
                                    appearance and managed to have the case thrown out because he was, in effect,
                                    “wearing” a seat belt. He did say, though, that the judge was incensed by the stunt.

                                <p>Earl’s history with shooting and his mechanical inclinations eventually led him to
                                    the firearms business. Earl has been building and repairing German Walther firearms
                                    for almost fifty years. He trained as a mechanical engineer at Lowell Technology
                                    Institute but, because of an illness, had to take some time off, thus losing his
                                    draft deferment. He was drafted into the Army in 1969. His association with the
                                    Walther factory began in the early 1980s when he was a competition pistol shooter.
                                    He told me he was “looking for a pistol that could outshoot my eyes.”</p>

                                <p>The search led him to the 1936 Walther Olympian Pistol and the Smith &amp; Wesson
                                    Model 41 competition pistol. He eventually moved to the Walther OSP and GSP, though
                                    he was not quite satisfied with either. He began making his own modifications and
                                    traveled to Germany to seek direct help from Walther. Earl was able to work directly
                                    with Walther engineers in Ulm, becoming thoroughly familiar with their operations.
                                    Earl helped with improvements to the GSP and is personally responsible for the
                                    modular aspects that are now an integral part of the system.</p>

                                <p>A direct result of this work was the GSP rifle, which was developed in response to
                                    the outlawing of handguns in England after the 1996 Dunblane, Scotland shooting. Gun
                                    owners had to either turn in their weapons or export them. Earl developed the GSP
                                    Rifle system to allow British competition shooters to send their pistols to Ulm,
                                    where they were converted to rifles and sent back. We know how that turned out in
                                    the end, but British shooters were provided with a brief respite from that country’s
                                    onerous gun laws. The GSP Rifle is now an integral part of the Walther competition
                                    lineup, and Earl has exclusivity for the product in the US market.</p>

                                <p>The ERS shop is full of goodies, firearms related and otherwise. I could go on for
                                    hours about the special commemorative edition PPs, PPKs, and P38s, but my fingers
                                    would wear out from the typing.</p>
                                <p>Earl has the very first post-WWII P38 to roll off the line.</p>
                                <p>He also has a model MP, a forerunner to the P38, which was the personal sidearm of
                                    Fritz Walther, the dude who ran the company when the P38 was developed. It was
                                    confiscated by the US Army in 1945 and is accompanied by the certificate stamped by
                                    HQ US Forces, European Theater. He also has the first functional DA/SA pistol in the
                                    world, a 6.35mm (.25 ACP) prototype developed by Walther in the early 20th Century.
                                    Not an example of the pistol, but the very first one. Then there are the unique
                                    models like the Model 3-4 hybrid, the special P99, of which only twenty were made,
                                    complete with a presentation letter from Walther, and the last edition PP. There are
                                    presentation-grade specimens, too, like the gilded PP and P38.</p>

                                <p>ERS deals in modern German Walther firearms as well, with the P99, PPQ, PPS, and CCP
                                    joining the dozens of factory PPs, PPKs, and P38/P1s. There’s even a P88 and a rare
                                    P88 Compact, along with several of the excellent P5s, which were the ultimate
                                    evolution of the P38 in the Walther arsenal.</p>

                                <p>Other cool stuff includes the aforementioned Kubelwagen, a vintage copy of Adolf
                                    Hitler’s Mein Kampf, and a special plaque with Hitler’s relief portrait that was
                                    presented to the Walther firm when it was headquartered in the town of Zella-Mehlis
                                    before and during the war. There is an authentic Hitler Youth knife, the MG 34
                                    machine gun (complete with packaged ammo and extra barrels), a case of shells for
                                    the famous German 88mm gun, a special P99 edition bicycle made for the German
                                    police…</p>
                                <p><em>Lots </em>to see.</p>
                                <p>Another cool thing is the very last production model of the Volkswagen Beetle to roll
                                    off the assembly line in Mexico in 2004. It has fifty kilometers on the odometer.

                                <p>Despite this, Earl has never been directly affiliated with the Walther corporation.
                                    Earl’s Repair Service (ERS, Inc.) is the premiere Walther parts and repair
                                    establishment in the US, outside Walther USA of Fort Smith, Arkansas. The ERS
                                    business cards feature the German phrase “<em>Kenner wählen</em>” with the Walther
                                    logo, which translates roughly as “Experts Choose Walther.” This is from a 1970s
                                    Walther ad that said “People in the know choose Walther.” Earl has essentially
                                    become “Mr. Walther” in the US. His knowledge is encyclopedic. Trust me, I’ve talked
                                    with him about German Walther products and service for hours.</p>

                                <p>Service is what ERS is all about. Earl considers himself an artisan rather than an
                                    engineer. He dedicates himself to top-shelf work and he backs it up with customer
                                    service. If you bring something into his shop, he will fix it while you wait, if
                                    possible. Otherwise, he strives for same-day service. His facility houses
                                    <em>3000</em> German Walther pistols and rifles, and 750,000 parts dating from 1900
                                    to the present.</p>
                                <p>The parts are not knock-offs, either; he deals only in original German Walther
                                    factory parts. The reader may notice that I keep using the term “German Walther.”
                                    There’s a reason for that. Earl only deals in German-manufactured Walther products
                                    and is quick to point out the distinction.</p>
                                <p>Sometimes Earl receives a request for a part that he doesn’t have and can’t get. In
                                    such a case, he machines a new part in his own shop to factory specs. He informs the
                                    customer of this, too, as some collectors only want original parts. He refuses to
                                    deal in cast parts and will not stock a firearm that doesn’t meet his standards,
                                    even if it’s a Walther product. This does lead to some of his prices being higher
                                    than other places, but that’s the norm in the firearms industry anyway. On occasion,
                                    it has also led to a somewhat adversarial relationship with Walther. If he sees
                                    something he doesn’t like about the company, his characteristic bluntness comes to
                                    the fore. If quality is your thing, Earl is your guy.</p>

                                <p>He showed me something that really drove home the importance of quality. Earl also
                                    deals in original German Korth firearms, though he doesn’t have many due to their
                                    stiff price tag and the fact that the company is no longer in business. He received
                                    a Korth .357 magnum in for repair once; the owner said that he had put six rounds
                                    through it but couldn’t hit the target at all…at seven yards.</p>
                                <p>As it turns out, the reason the guy couldn’t hit anything was that the first round
                                    was a squib load, and the bullet stuck in the barrel of the gun. He then fired five
                                    additional rounds of .357 magnum into the barrel after it. Hard to believe, but the
                                    gun survived with only a small bulge in the barrel. Earl showed it to me. The
                                    bullets are still stacked up in the barrel. He shaved away a cross-section to
                                    confirm it. That doesn’t mean we have to spend thousands of dollars on a Korth
                                    revolver, but the point was clear: quality matters.</p>
                                <p>Like, I have to convince anyone reading this of that fact.</p>

                                            did so, Earl pulled out a stack of like-new $2 bills. He took one off the
                                            stack and photocopied it. I was curious but didn’t say anything. When I was
                                            done, he said he hated the idea of the state charging that money for the
                                            state police to run the check instead of him calling NICS directly. I agreed
                                            and said it sounded like a revenue-generator to me, which he confirmed. He
                                            then told me that he pays all the $2 fees to the state with $2 bills in
                                            order to make it as inconvenient as possible for the bureaucrats. They
                                            initially told him that he had to pay it electronically, but he pointed out
                                            that the form only says “$2.00” and does not stipulate the form the payment
                                            must take. He was then told that they could not accept cash, to which he
                                            replied that the bills state that they are “legal tender for all debts
                                            public and private” and that they were issued by the government. The state
                                            countered by saying cash could not be tracked and that he and they had to
                                            have an invoice number for record-keeping purposes. Earl’s response was that
                                            each bill has a unique serial number and that he makes a copy of each one
                                            submitted for his records. He suggested they do the same. Finally, the state
                                            said cash wasn’t secure and that it could be stolen by someone in their
                                            office. Earl told them that it sounded like an internal problem to him and
                                            that they should hire more trustworthy people. The state finally gave up and
                                            he still sends them a $2 bill for every purchase. He does all this with a
                                            straight face and is dead serious about it. Truly a unique guy.”</span></p>
